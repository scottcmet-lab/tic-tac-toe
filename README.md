# tic-tac-toe
### Coding project for MIT course Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN

#### Description
A simple tic-tac-toe game using React.

#### Roadmap for Future Improvements
Future improvements would include preventing a previously selected square from being changed. This would involve changing the onClick handler to only fire when a square's value is null. Another improvement would be to detect for a draw. This could be implemented by setting the status after 9 turns if checkForWinner returns false. In this case, set status to "Game is a draw" and deactivate all squares.
